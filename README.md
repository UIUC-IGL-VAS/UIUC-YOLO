# UIUC-YOLO

This is the repo for all API-style usage of the YOLO software, and all new developments to plug in to the box-standard YOLO as it exists on https://github.com/pjreddie/darknet.
While we're making advancements in our fork of the above repo, we'll do our best to stay up to date with their work as well. This repo then, necessarily, will have some guides for using both repos, not just ours.
